# SchoolBusTracker

SchoolBusTracker is an application to track school buses in real time, manage routes, monitor student pickup/dropoff status, and notify guardians. The project includes a backend API, optional web dashboard, and mobile client integration for drivers and guardians.

## Key features
- Real-time location updates (GPS)
- Route management and scheduling
- Student assignment and attendance logging
- Push and SMS notifications for guardians
- Driver app for pickup/dropoff confirmation
- Role-based access control (admin, driver, guardian)

## Technology
- Backend: Node.js / Express (or your preferred stack)
- Database: PostgreSQL (or MongoDB)
- Real-time: WebSockets / Socket.IO
- Mobile: React Native / Flutter (optional)
- Hosting: Docker, Kubernetes or cloud provider

## Prerequisites
- Node.js >= 16
- PostgreSQL >= 13
- Docker (optional)
- Yarn or npm

## Quickstart (local)
1. Clone the repo
    ```
    git clone <repo-url>
    cd SchoolBusTracker
    ```
2. Install dependencies
    ```
    npm install
    ```
3. Configure environment variables (`.env`)
    ```
    DATABASE_URL=postgres://user:pass@localhost:5432/schoolbus
    JWT_SECRET=change_me
    PORT=4000
    PUSH_PROVIDER_KEY=...
    ```
4. Run migrations and seed (example)
    ```
    npm run migrate
    npm run seed
    ```
5. Start server
    ```
    npm start
    ```

## Docker
Build and run with Docker Compose:
```
docker-compose up --build
```
This starts the API and a database instance defined in docker-compose.yml.

## API (examples)
- POST /api/auth/login — authenticate user
- GET /api/buses/:id/location — current bus location
- POST /api/routes — create route (admin)
- POST /api/attendance — mark pickup/dropoff

Include API docs (OpenAPI/Swagger) in the repo for full contract details.

## Real-time updates
Use WebSocket or Socket.IO channels:
- connect to /ws
- subscribe to room `bus:{busId}` for location and status events

## Mobile client
- Driver app sends periodic GPS updates and confirms pickups
- Guardian app receives notifications and can view live bus location

## Data privacy & security
- Use HTTPS in production
- Encrypt sensitive data
- Store minimal personal data and follow local privacy regulations

## Testing
- Unit tests: `npm test`
- Integration tests: `npm run test:integration`
- Add CI pipeline to run tests and linters
